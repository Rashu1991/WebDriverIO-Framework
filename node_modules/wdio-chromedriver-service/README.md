WDIO ChromeDriver Service
================================

(Based entirely on [wdio-selenium-standalone-service](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/tree/master/packages/wdio-selenium-standalone-service).)

Note:
If you're working with WebdriverIO v6, use version 6.X.X\
If you're working with WebdriverIO v5, use version 5.X.X\

----

This service helps you to run ChromeDriver seamlessly when running tests with the [WDIO testrunner](http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/gettingstarted.html). It uses the [chromedriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver) NPM package that wraps the ChromeDriver for you.

Note - this service does not require a Selenium server, but uses ChromeDriver to communicate with the browser directly.
Obvisously, it only supports:

```js
capabilities: [{
        browserName: 'chrome'
    }]
```

## Installation

The easiest way is to keep `wdio-chromedriver-service` as a devDependency in your `package.json`.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "wdio-chromedriver-service": "^6.0.0"
  }
}
```

You can simple do it by:

```bash
npm install wdio-chromedriver-service --save-dev
```

Note! You have to install [chromedriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver)  separately, as it's a peerDependency of this project, and you're free to choose what version to use. Install it using:

```bash
npm install chromedriver --save-dev
```

Instructions on how to install `WebdriverIO` can be found [here.](http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/install.html)

## Configuration

By design, only Google Chrome is available (when installed on the host system). In order to use the service you need to add `chromedriver` to your service array:

```js
// wdio.conf.js
export.config = {
  outputDir: 'all-logs',
  // ...
  services: [
    ['chromedriver', {
        outputDir: 'driver-logs', // overwrites the config.outputDir
        args: ['--silent'] //
    }]
  ],
  // ...
};
```

## Options

### port
The port on which the driver should run on

Example: 7676

Type: `number`

### path
The path on which the driver should run on

Example:  `/wd/hub`

Type: `string`

### protocol
The protocol on which the driver should use

Example:  `http`

Type: `string`

### hostname
The protocol on which the driver should use

Example:  `localhost`

Type: `string`

### outputDir
The path where the output of the ChromeDriver server should be stored (uses the config.outputDir by default when not set).

Example: `driver-logs`

Type: `string`
